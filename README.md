# zsh-custom

This is my custom configuration for my oh-my-zsh installation.

# Usage

**1. Clone the repository**

I recommend cloning this repository to your user directory with the following command:

```
$> git clone git@github.com:joshminnie/zsh-custom.git .zsh-custom
```

**2. Update your .zshrc configuration**

Update your .zshrc configuration by defining the variable, `ZSH_CUSTOM`. You may already have this defined or at least present in the original file. If you do just uncomment it and update the value.

```
ZSH_CUSTOM=/path/to/.zsh-custom
```

**3. Restart your zshell.**

```
$> source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```
